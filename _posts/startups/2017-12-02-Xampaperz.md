description: Bringing the digitized resources to stand-alone web platform is an excellent innovation considering it eases life for people who are on the internet more than in library or along with the books. Why should an essential part of our academic lives - exam preparation, remain outside the scope of Internet? After you get out of school the real struggle begins Where to go, Which college to go for, Which exams to appear, What i am eligible for. If not done anything contemplating all these things makes one skeptical and depressed. And most of the students end up getting in the college not of their will. XAMPAPERZ is the platform that was designed solely for purpose of providing quality and adequate information about the College/University that you thought of getting into or your family wants you to be in.

My Start-up journey begins with this student run organisation of my seniors at university school. The challenges faced by TechSpace, gave me an opportunity to meet the awesome selfish giants :P of campus, [Mr. Santosh Pant][Santosh-pant] & Shyam Hundiwal among others. I met them for a help in PHP code for TechSpace's Website and after regular meetings, xampaperz was on table. They were already working on the idea and i was fascinated to join them.

With such a great group, I started my xampaperz life in September 2014. I started with contributing in the programming team and leading the operations and management. In my freshmen year, it was quite a challenging task to lead two organisation at a time. The leadership quality was an inbuilt feature of mine and seperation from the group was it's inherent result :xD. 

It happened exactly same with my journey at xampaperz. I started as a member of programming team, but eventually ended up developing the strategy, UI, UX, Database and even time-table for the team. Developing a Team, handling the dynamic goals of members of the team and keeping the goal of xampaperz synchronized with theirs was most challenging task. I learnt the significance of members and their personal goals.

It's been three year, and xampaperz is now in hands of our successors. Team decided to pass over the management of xampaperz to [Entrepreneurship Cell][e-cell] of university. 

Also there is much more to write on xampaperz, this being my first blog on Xampaperz, so I will keep myself restricted with my emotions overflowing.
